- Random Short is a simple program written in python that can sort an array of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm. 
- This program is designed to be a quick and easy solution for sorting small arrays of integers.

<h1 align="center"> Getting Started</h1>

- To get started with Random Short, you'll need to have a C compiler installed on your computer.
-  Random Short has been tested with GCC and Clang, but it should work with any C compiler that supports the C99 standard.

Clone the repository to your:
 local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-short.git
Compile the program using your preferred C.
 compiler: gcc random_short.c -o random_short
Run the program: ./random_short
<h1 align="center" >Usage</h1>

- Random Short takes an array of integers as input, sorts them using the Bubble Sort algorithm, and outputs the sorted array to the console.
- To use Random Short, simply modify the main() function in the random_short.c file to include your own array of integers, then compile and run the program as described in the Getting Started section.
