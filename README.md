Random Short is a simple program written in C that can sort an array of integers using the Bubble Sort algorithm. This program is designed to be a quick and easy solution for sorting small arrays of integers.

Getting Started
To get started with Random Short, you'll need to have a C compiler installed on your computer. Random Short has been tested with GCC and Clang, but it should work with any C compiler that supports the C99 standard.

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-short.git
Compile the program using your preferred C compiler: gcc random_short.c -o random_short
Run the program: ./random_short
Usage
Random Short takes an array of integers as input, sorts them using the Bubble Sort algorithm, and outputs the sorted array to the console. To use Random Short, simply modify the main() function in the random_short.c file to include your own array of integers, then compile and run the program as described in the Getting Started section.
